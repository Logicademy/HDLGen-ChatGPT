	~ Each prompt has an accompanying explanation (in a comment)
	~ Prompts are included which request generate of specific code output
	~ Prompts are included which request avoidance of generating specific code output
	~ b) HDL model template, generated by HDLGen-ChatGPT.
	
	~ 2. The VHDL model template includes the following sections:
	~ Title (creation date, component name, description, creator details, signal dictionary)
	~ VHDL library declarations, including IEEE 1164 (VHDL) libraries, IEEE.numeric_std library and a MainPackage library, located in the project environment folder.
	~ VHDL entity declaration, describing input and output signals and their signal types
	~ VHDL architecture

	~ 3. HDLGen-ChatGPT (https://github.com/fearghal1/HDLGen-ChatGPT)has been tested primarily using the free GPT-3.5
	~ Later (subscription-based) GPT releases are expected to produce similar or better quality results
	~ Note that ChatGPT does not always generate output exactly as expected
	
	~ 4. You can modify/edit this ChatGPT HDL model completion prompt header. If so, include explanatiom using the ~ comment prefix
	
	~ 5. Individual prompts (from this list, or new prompts) can be submitted as individual prompts, following a ChatGPT run, to refine the output
	~ Examples:
	~ Enter 'continue' to continue incomplete output to a code box
	~ Click the ChatGPT menu '> Continue generating' button if it appears, to continue incomplete output to a code box
	~ Copy any prompt from this file and paste in the ChatGPT message box and click the arrow
	~ Type a new prompt in the ChatGPT message box and click the arrow
	~ Notes END	===============
	
	~ Main prompt to ChatGPT
	Complete the following VHDL model, and output in a single formatted code box.
	
	~ The next lines are auto-populated by HDLGen-ChatGPT, based on process and concurrent statements in the VHDL model template.
	~ In HDLGen-ChatGPT 'Generate > Edit ChatGPT Prompt Header' menu, uncomment one of the following lines to output a specific selected process or concurrent statement.
	~***Reserved for processes***
	~***Reserved for concurrent statements***
	
	~ Retain VHDL comments unchanged
	Do not remove any comments beginning with '-- ', i.e, only two dashes
	
	~ Enhance the title section text, e.g, align and format text
	~ Remove/add the comment (~) character on the next two lines, to activate/deactivate.
	~ Deactivation speeds up the ChatGPT HDL model completion, by removing the title section generation.
	~ Do not include the code between and including lines '-- Title Section Start' and '-- Title Section End'.
	For each line between -- Title section start and -- Title section end, improve the text formatting
	
	For each line containing the prefix '---', generate VHDL code describing the logic, applying the following rules.
	~ Translate model combination logic pseudo code lines which include the '---' prefix to syntactically-correct HDL.
	Remove the '--- '  prefix from the line.
	~ Remove the --- after processing.
	
	For arithmetic operations, use type casting to support signal type requirements in ieee.numeric_std arithmetic functions.
	~ If ChatGPT generates addOut <= addin1 + addIn0;  for std_logic_vector signals, the EDA tool may highlight an error,
	~  such as 'Cannot determine exact overloaded match definition for "+"'
	~ If so, re-run the above prompt
	~ Arithmetic operations are supported by the IEEE.numeric_std library, https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/packages/numeric_std.vhd
	~ e.g, operations such as + (addition) often require input signal type conversion to support the overloaded operator functions,
	~ + function supports the following overloaded operations
	~ -- Id: A.3  function "+" ( L,R: UNSIGNED)           return UNSIGNED
	~ -- Id: A.4  function "+" ( L,R: SIGNED)             return SIGNED;
	~ -- Id: A.5  function "+" ( L: UNSIGNED; R: NATURAL) return UNSIGNED;
	~ -- Id: A.6  function "+" ( L: NATURAL; R: UNSIGNED) return UNSIGNED;
	~ -- Id: A.7  function "+" ( L: INTEGER; R: SIGNED)   return SIGNED;
	~ -- Id: A.8  function "+" ( L: SIGNED; R: INTEGER)   return SIGNED;
	~ Example: addOut <= std_logic_vector (unsigned(addin1) + unsigned(addIn0) );
	~  Uses A.3 function "+" ( L,R: UNSIGNED) return UNSIGNED
	~  Adds two std_logic_vector (slv) signals. Convert (type cast) slv signals to unsigned type, perform +, and then type cast the unsigned result to std_logic_vector type
	
	If a line includes a std_logic_vector signal as an array index, convert the signal to an integer index using "ieee.numeric_std" package to_integer(unsigned()).
	~ If using a std_logic_vector signal as an integer index, convert (type cast) the signal to unsigned type,
	~ and the unsigned signal to integer type (TO_INTEGER function D.1) and use as integer array index
	~ -- Id: D.1  function TO_INTEGER ( ARG: UNSIGNED) return NATURAL;
	~ -- Id: D.2  function TO_INTEGER ( ARG: SIGNED) return INTEGER;
	~ -- Id: D.3  function TO_UNSIGNED (  ARG,SIZE: NATURAL) return UNSIGNED;
	~ -- Id: D.4  function TO_SIGNED ( ARG: INTEGER; SIZE: NATURAL) return SIGNED;
	~ -- Id: D.5  function TO_UNSIGNED ( ARG: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR) return UNSIGNED;
	~ -- Id: D.6  function TO_SIGNED ( ARG: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR) return SIGNED;
	~ -- Id: D.7  function TO_STDLOGICVECTOR ( ARG: UNSIGNED) return STD_LOGIC_VECTOR;
	~ -- Id: D.8  function TO_STDLOGICVECTOR ( ARG: SIGNED) return STD_LOGIC_VECTOR;
	
	Convert shift_left and shift_right function outputs to signal type std_logic_vector.
	~ Bit shift handling
	~ This assumes that the target signal type is std_logic_vector. If not so, remove or modify the above line.
	Only use ieee.numeric_std package shift_left or shift_right functions, and do not use sra, srl, sll, shift_right_arithmetic functions, introduced in IEEE VHDL-2008
	~ Self-explanatory
	If a line includes a >>> shift right arithmetic operation, use ieee.numeric_std package shift_right function, assuming signed data.
	~ Use >>> pseudo code operator for shift right arithmetic operation. VHDL functions require signed input signals.
	
	Use hexadecimal signal format where the number of bits in the assignment is a multiple of 4, extending the hex value to the exact width of the target signal.
	Make assignment and equality check bit widths compatible.
	~ Self-explanatory
	
	Leave all labels unchanged.
	~ HDLGen-ChatGPT captures the labels for the design processes, concurrent statements and component instantiation.
	~ Labels are used for browsing the design in the EDA tools.
	
	For each line containing '_c:' in the label, generate a concurrent VHDL statement, do not generate a process statement, do not remove the label, remove the '---', and remove '-- Default assignment'
	~ Avoids ChatGPT translating a VHDL concurrent statement (labelled _c) into a VHDL process statement
	
	Remove all assignments in if or case statements which duplicate the default assignment.
	Include null in others case statement if a default assignment is included in a case statement
	~ HDLGen-ChatGPT 'Architecture > process' menu uses the following menus and combinational process logic description approach
	~ default signal assignment
	~ non-default signal assignment
	~ The default signal assignment is only required once. This prompt avoids ChatGPT including duplicates.
	
	For all case statements, include "when others => null;" before every occurrence of an "end case" statement.
	~ VHDL syntax requirement
	
	Within all VHDL processes, do not remove the line containing '-- Default assignment', and place it immediately before the VHDL statements generated for lines containing prefix '--- '.
	~ Avoids ChatGPT incorrectly re-ordering statements, and ensures the correct ordering of VHDL statements, provided in HDLGen-ChatGPT HDL template
	
	In assignments which include signals with one bit extension, e.g, (0 & CSUpr) or  (1 & CSUpr), use single quotes around the single bit value 0 or 1 and do not use double quotes "".
	For example, generate ('0' & CSUpr) from VHDL (0 & CSUpr)
	~ Extending a signal
	~ Example: addOut <= std_logic_vector(unsigned('0' & CSUpr) + unsigned('0' & addInB)); where addOut signal is 6-bit std_logic_vector(5 downto 0), CSRUpr / addInB signals are 5-bit std_logic_vector(4 downto 0)
	
	Do not remove any library statements, do not add any new library 'use' statements, to avoid conflicts with the ieee.numeric_std package functions.
	~ Self explanatory
	
	Only use VHDL which is support by the IEEE VHDL-1987 standard.
	~ Not all Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools support VHDL-2008, so stick with VHDL-1987 standard
	
	In all VHDL processes, replace each conditional when else statement with a case statement or an if statement, without removing any signal state check, and not including any assignments which duplicate the assignment labelled '-- Default assignment'
	~ Conditional statements are supported in IEEE VHDL-2008 though not all EDA tools support VHDL-2008, so do not allow conditional statements
	~ ChatGPT does not always follow this prompt, so it may be necessary to submit this prompt again, after the ChatGPT run.

	For signal which have a digit boundary width, use hexadecimal format in constant assignments, with 'x' prefix before double quotation marks.

	Within all VHDL processes, do not remove the line containing '-- Default assignment', and place it immediately before the VHDL statements generated for lines containing prefix '--- '.
	~ Avoids ChatGPT incorrectly re-ordering statements, and ensures the correct ordering of VHDL statements, provided in HDLGen-ChatGPT HDL template
	
	In assignments which include signals with one bit extension, e.g, (0 & CSUpr) or  (1 & CSUpr), use single quotes around the single bit value 0 or 1 and do not use double quotes "".
	For example, generate ('0' & CSUpr) from VHDL (0 & CSUpr)
	~ Extending a signal
	~ Example: addOut <= std_logic_vector(unsigned('0' & CSUpr) + unsigned('0' & addInB)); where addOut signal is 6-bit std_logic_vector(5 downto 0), CSRUpr / addInB signals are 5-bit std_logic_vector(4 downto 0)
	
	Do not remove any library statements, do not add any new library 'use' statements, to avoid conflicts with the ieee.numeric_std package functions.
	~ Self explanatory
	
	Only use VHDL which is support by the IEEE VHDL-1987 standard.
	~ Not all Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools support VHDL-2008, so stick with VHDL-1987 standard
	
	In all VHDL processes, replace each conditional when else statement with a case statement or an if statement, without removing any signal state check, and not including any assignments which duplicate the assignment labelled '-- Default assignment'
	~ Conditional statements are supported in IEEE VHDL-2008 though not all EDA tools support VHDL-2008, so do not allow conditional statements
	~ ChatGPT does not always follow this prompt, so it may be necessary to submit this prompt again, after the ChatGPT run.
	
	For signal which have a digit boundary width, use hexadecimal format in constant assignments, with 'x' prefix before double quotation marks.
